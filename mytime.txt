1.Simulate the UNIX utility time that shows the time taken by a program. Your command line syntax should be as follows: (mytime command). 

This program should invoke a program which gets the CPU time, forks a child to run command and when the child returns gets the CPU time again and prints the difference between the two times. You do not need to re-invent the concept of time. You can use a built-in Unix/Linux timer utility to keep the time. 

NOT simply write a wrapper program to call the UNIX/Linux “sleep” function.
